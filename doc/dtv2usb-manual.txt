dtv2usb Manual

1. Introduction

This manual summarizes the usage of the dtv2usb board described in the
dtv2usb.sch and dtv2usb.brd Eagle (from www.cadsoft.de) files.


2. Hardware Setup

2.1 Overview

On the board there are two pin heads labeled JP1 and JP2.

JP1 is used to connect an AVR ISP to initially flash the bootloader or the
firmware of the ATmega8. Later the JP1 pins can be used to connect an external
(optional) reset button and place a jumper to enter the bootloader mode:

      ^^^ DB9 Connector ^^^

      JP1   1o o
             o o
             x x   <-- Reset button connector
             o o
             *-*   <-- Bootloader Jumper (place and reset to enter bootloader)
             
JP2 is used to select the power source of the dtv2usb board:

      ^^^ DB9 Connector ^^^

      JP2    o o o
      
             *-* o  <-- Power via USB (normal operation)
             o *-*  <-- Power via ISP connector (only used for ISP flash)

There are five LEDs on the board:

      ^^^ DB9 Connector ^^^
      
                      LED3 *    Error (red)
                      LED2 *    Transmit/Bootloader (yellow)
                      LED1 *    Ready (green)
                      
                      
      * LED4  RS232 Tx (yellow)
      * LED5  RS232 Rx (green)


2.2 Initial Flash Operation

On a fresh dtv2board, the ATmega8 needs a bootloader flashed via the ISP
connector. You need an ISP programmer (e.g. the USBasp 
http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/) for this:

  - disconnect the dtv2usb
  - place JP2 to ISP power (see 2.1)
  - attach the ISP with a 10 pin cable to JP1 (pin 1 at top left of JP1)
  - attach the ISP via USB to your PC
  - enter "server" directory of this distribution within a shell and call:

      > make prog_bootloader

  - use AVRDUDE_ISP_PROGRAMMER and AVRDUDE_ISP_PORT to select your programmer:

      > make prog_bootloader AVRDUDE_ISP_PROGRAMMER=usbasp AVRDUDE_ISP_PORT=

Now the ATmega8 needs the correct fuse bits set:

      > make prog_fuse

  - again you can use AVRDUDE_ISP_PROGRAMMER and AVRDUDE_ISP_PORT to config
    your ISP.

Disconnect your ISP now and set the power connector JP2 back to normal
operation (see 2.1)


2.3 Bootloader Mode

You need to enter Bootloader Mode to flash a new firmware version directly via
the USB port without any external ISP.

  ** enter bootloader mode:

  - disconnect dtv2usb from the PC and the DTV
  - place the bootloader jumper on JP1 (see 2.1)
  - make sure JP2 is set to USB power
  - attach the dtv2usb only to your PC
  
  - the orange LED2 is now lit and signals that the bootloader mode is active
  
  ** flash the firmware
  
  - enter the "server" directory of this distribution and call:
  
    make prog_dist FILE=flash/dtv2ser-<version>-230400-cvm8board-atmega8.hex \
                   AVRDUDE_BOOTLOADER_PORT="-P /dev/cu.usbserial-*"
    
    set the bootloader port to the correct virtual serial port that was
    assigned to the dtv2ser. This varies on every system. Use your favorite
    USB inspector tool to find this out.
    
  - now the firmware is flashed
  
  ** leave bootloader mode:
  
  - disconnect dtv2usb from the PC
  - remove the bootloader jumper on JP1 (see 2.1)
  - attach the dtv2usb to your PC
  
  - the green LED1 is now lit and signals that the dtv2ser firmware operates
    normally and bootloader mode was left successfully


2.4 Normal Operation

  - make sure the bootloader jumper on JP1 is removed (see 2.1)
  - make sure the power jumper JP2 is set to normal operation (see 2.1)
  
  ** attach the dtv2usb
  
  - power off the DTV
  - attach the dtv2usb to the DTV's joystick port (usually port 2)
  - attach the dtv2usb via USB (and an optional USB extension cord) to your host
  - the green LED1 of the dtv2usb is now lit
  - power on the DTV
  
  ** detach the dtv2usb

  - remove the dtv2usb from the USB port of the PC
  - power off the DTV
  - remove the dtv2usb from the DTV's joystick port


2.5 Hardware Test

  - set up normal operation (see 2.4)
  - enter the "client" directory of this distribution
  - call:
  
      ./dtv2sertrans -p /dev/cu.usbserial-* -s 230400 reset + diag testsuite
      
    Make sure to set the correct serial port with -p and the correct
    serial speed (-s) you flashed in the firmware!

    This command sequence will reset the DTV and enters dtvtrans mode
    automatically (assuming you have DTVmon >= 1.1 installed).
    Then it performs a series of internal and external transfer tests.
    
THE END
