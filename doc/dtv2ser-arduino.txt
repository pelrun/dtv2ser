Using an Arduino Board with the dtv2ser firmware

1. Introduction
---------------

The original dtv2ser project uses a custom made board with an ATmega8 to
provide the interface between a serial port and the DTV dtvtrans software. The
layout and the schematics for the board are freely available but unfortunately
most users have difficulties to create the HW from scratch.

With the Arduino platform[1] an AVR ATmega platform was released to the public
that is available very easily and rather cheap. This document describes how to
transform an off-the shelve Arduino board into a dtv2ser device. The HW
modifications required are very simple and this allows even unexperienced
users to create their own device.

2. HW Requirements
------------------

 * An "Arduino 2009" aka "Arduino Duemilanove" board
 * 3 LEDs (red, green, blue)
 * 3 220 Ohm Resistors
 * A DB9 female connector (for the DTV joystick port)
 * some wire

The Arduino2009 has an ATmega168 with 16 MHz clock frequency on the board and
provides a USB/Serial connector with a FT232 chip that has HW RTS/CTS
handshaking support.

You can use one of the many Arduino clones (Seeduino, ...) if they have
similar HW parameters.

Unfortunately, the new Arduino Uno is not supported yet, as it does not allow
to enable HW RTS/CTS handshaking on the USB controller with the current
firmware...

The Arduino2009's USB to serial connector is used with 250kB/s as a transfer
rate. Please make sure that your host operating system allows to set this
non-standard speed. Its reported to work on Mac OS X and Windows with the FTDI
drivers.


3. HW Build Instructions
------------------------

 3.1 Add CTS Line to the AVR
 ---------------------------

The vanilla Arduino board does not allow to control the HW CTS serial signal
from the AVR chip. But this is required to allow high performance data
transfer for the dtv2ser firmware. Fortunately, this signal of the FT232 chip
is available on the solder pad X3 and can be added by soldering a wire from
there to a pin that is connected to the AVR port labeled "DIGITAL 2".

   Solder Pad X3                                          DIGITAL .

                                                                  * 1 TX
                                                                  * 0 RX
 3.2 Add the dtv2ser LEDs
 ------------------------

The dtv2ser uses three LEDs in green, orange and red to signal its internal
status to the user. In this step we add those LEDs by simple connecting them
with a resistor each to the DIGITAL pins 8, 9 and, 10. The positive side of
each LED is connected to +5V that is available on the POWER connector.

                       Red LED
   Reset *         +------>|----| 220 |--------------* DIGITAL 10
     3V3 *         |  Orange LED
      5V *---------+------>|----| 220 |--------------* DIGITAL 9
     GND *         |  Green LED
     GND *--+      +------>|----| 220 |--------------* DIGITAL 8
     Vin *  |
            |
            v  This line is used in section 3.3
   
 3.3 Add the joystick connector
 ------------------------------

Finally, the Arduino needs to be connected to your DTV. As dtvtrans uses one
of the joystick ports for communication it is quite common to use a DB9
standard joystick connector for this.

The 6 signal lines and GND need to be soldered to the DB9 (female) connector
and on some pin headers to get connected to the Arduino on the connector
labeled "ANALOG IN".

  DB9 Connector               DB9          ANALOG IN 
  (rear view)                  1 * ----------- * 0
                               2 * ----------- * 1 
  1 2 3 4 5                    3 * ----------- * 2
  * * * * *                    4 * ----------- * 3
   * * * *                     6 * ----------- * 4
   6 7 8 9                     9 * ----------- * 5

                              DB9          POWER CONNECTOR (see 3.2)
                               8 * ----------- * GND
 
  That's it! Now your arduino is a dtv2ser board ;)


4. Flash the firmware
---------------------

I use the avrdude[1] command line tool to flash the firmware.
But you can use any downloader SW that supports flashing the arduino.

The firmware file is called "dtv2ser-x.y-250000-arduino2009-atmega168.hex"
with x.y being the current version of dtv2ser. This file comes with this
distribution.

Connect your Arduino board to your Mac or PC and find out the serial port
where it is connected (here on my Mac: /dev/cu.usbserial-A7006RWQ, on PCs
something like COM5, on Linux /dev/ttyUSB0).

The following command flashes the firmware:

> cd server
> make prog_arduino2009 LDR_PORT=<serial port>

or without Makefile call:

> avrdude avrdude -p m168 -c arduino -P <serial port> \
   -b 19200 -U flash:w:dtv2ser-0.5-250000-arduino2009-atmega168.hex

Note: this line is wrapped. Type everything into a single line!

If everything worked fine then your newly attached Green LED goes on after a
reset.

5. Using dtv2sertrans Host SW
-----------------------------

Starting from version 0.4 the dtv2sertrans SW directly supports the arduino
board. See the manual for this tool for further details.

Note the following:

* The arduino uses a baud rate of 250kB/s and not 240kB/s as set as default.
  So you have to specify the -s switch or set the DTV2SER_SPEED environment
  variable:

  > ./dtv2sertrans -s 250000 ...



That's it! Have fun using dtv2ser...
