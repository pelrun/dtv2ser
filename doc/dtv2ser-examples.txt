dtv2ser-examples.txt

this file gives examples how to call the dtv2sertrans command tool

call ./dtv2sertrans -h to get an overview of all commands.
call ./dtv2sertrans <command> -h to get help on the command's options


1. control DTV
--------------

> dtv2sertrans reset

   reset the DTV (and enters dtvtrans in dtvmon >= 1.1)
   then the Kernal and the Basic is initialized
   
   add -n to omit the initialization
   with -B -b -K and -k you can control what should be initialized
   
> dtv2sertrans reset -d

   reset the DTV and do not enter dtvtrans but enter dtvboot menu if available.
   no Kernal or Basic is initialized
   
> dtv2sertrans reset -N

   reset the DTV and bypass dtvtrans and dtvboot.
   runs INTRO prg.


2. data transfer
----------------

> dtv2sertrans write test.prg

   write a program file to DTV's RAM

> dtv2sertrans write 0x400 dump.prg

   write a program file at address 0x400 to DTV's RAM

> dtv2sertrans read test.prg

   save current basic program from DTV's RAM to a file

> dtv2sertrans read 0x400,0x200 dump.bin

   read 0x200 bytes starting at 0x400 from DTV's RAM to a file

> dtv2sertrans read 0x400-0x800 dump.bin

   read from 0x400 to 0x800 from DTV's RAM to a file

> dtv2sertrans read r0x10000-0x14000 rom.bin

   read from DTV's ROM to a file

> dtv2sertrans verify dump.prg

   read from DTV's RAM and verify with file contents

> dtv2sertrans verify 0x400 test.prg

   read from DTV's RAM at 0x400 and compare with file contents

Note: If a file has a *.prg extension then the first two bytes are assumed
to be the load address. If the extension is *.bin, *.img, *.txt or *.raw
then raw data is assumed. For all other types of extensions you have to
specify the type with the -l or -r switch.


3. basic commands (new in 0.4)
------------------------------

> dtv2sertrans load test.prg

  transfer the file test.prg to the DTV and simulate a basic LOAD command
  
  add -N to skip simulation of a BASIC LOAD 
    (similar to 'write' command)
  add -n to skip relinking
  
> dtv2sertrans save test.prg

  save the program on the DTV by transferring it back
    (similar to 'read' command)

> dtv2sertrans run

  issue a RUN command on the DTV

> dtv2sertrans exit

  do EXIT command and leave dtvtrans server to BASIC
  
  add -n to exit only without clear
  
> dtv2sertrans init

  perform a Kernal or BASIC initialization

  add -B -b -K or -k to control what to init


4. parameter commands
---------------------

> dtv2sertrans param dump

    show all parameters and their current values

> dtv2sertrans param set_byte 0 7

    set byte parameter #00 to value 7

> dtv2sertrans param set_word 4 0xf000

    set word parameter #04 to value 0xf000

> dtv2sertrans param save

    save all parameters to EEPROM on dtv2ser device

> dtv2sertrans param load

    load all parameters from EEPROM on dtv2ser device

> dtv2sertrans param reset

    reset all parameters to their default value


5. diagnose commands
--------------------

> dtv2sertrans diagnose testsuite

    run a set of tests

> dtv2sertrans diagnose read_only_client 0x10000

    download 0x10000 bytes from the server device and measure max.
    serial download rate

> dtv2sertrans diagnose write_only_client 0x10000

    upload 0x10000 bytes to the server device and measure max.
    serial upload rate

> dtv2sertrans diagnose read_only_dtv 0x10000,0x10000

    read 0x10000 bytes from DTV's RAM at 0x10000 but do not transfer them
    via serial. this measures the dtvtrans download rate.

> dtv2sertrans diagnose write_only_dtv 0x10000,0x10000

    write 0x10000 pattern bytes to DTV's RAM at 0x10000 but do not transfer
    them via serial. this measures the dtvtrans upload rate.

> dtv2sertrans diagnose verify_only_dtv 0x10000,0x10000

    read 0x10000 bytes from DTV's RAM at 0x10000 and check that all of them
    have the pattern byte value. use this to verify that write_only_dtv
    did succeed.

> dtv2sertrans diagnose sys 100  (new in 0.4)

    run the sys call test. download a small test program to the DTV and
    test if it can be executed.
    repeat the call 100 times with different duration paremeters to see
    if the 


6. command queueing and sleep
-----------------------------

queue commands on a command line by separating them with a '+' sign

> dtv2sertrans reset + write test.prg + go 2071

   first reset DTV, then write test.prg and finally jump to address 2071

> dtv2sertrans sleep 2

   sleep two seconds. useful when queueing commands:

> dtv2sertrans reset + write dtvtrans_joy1.prg  + go 2069 + sleep 2 + reset + go 700

   load the dtvtrans program, run it, wait a bit, reset and launch it


7. joy stream and autotype (new in 0.3)
---------------------------------------

> dtv2sertrans joy stream -i "4l5uf"

   move joystick 4 times left, 5 times up and press fire

> dtv2sertrans bootstrap basic

   enter command prompt with virtual keyboard
    
> dtv2sertrans joy type -i "HELLO, WORLD!"

   type a string immediately
   
   see 'dtv2ser-joystick.txt' for more details!
  

8. bootstrap DTV into dtvtrans (new in 0.3)
-------------------------------------------

> dtv2sertrans boot mlboot_joy1.prg

   transfer initial bootloader (here from TLR's dtvtrans distribution)
   needs running boot.prg on the DTV as the boot command uses a slightly
   different protocol. 
   (new in 0.2)

> dtv2sertrans -i bootstrap full

   You need to attach the dtv2ser in Joyport 2!

   dtv2sertrans first resets the device and then waits for the picture show
   at cold start. After 20 seconds it starts wiggling the joystick for 20
   secs to change from LOAD"*" into LOAD"$". After that move the joystick
   up eight times and press fire to select the "BASIC PROMPT". Wait until
   the prompt is enabled then autotype the boot.txt basic program. The
   bootloader waits and gets the second stage mlboot_joy2_auto.prg loaded
   and started. This stages receives the final dtvtrans and runs it...

   Make sure the required boot files are in the current directory. They
   are available in TLR's dtvtrans 1.0 distribution:

    boot.txt mlboot_joy2.prg dtvtrans_joy2.prg
    
   see 'dtv2ser-joystick.txt' section 3 for more details!

> dtv2sertrans -i bootstrap -s full

   New experimental faster screen code based bootstrap mode


9. flash commands (new in 0.4)
------------------------------

> dtv2sertrans flash id

  determine the type of flash ROM you have installed in your DTV

> dtv2sertrans flash map

  display a graphical map of the ROM usage. Mark empty regions.

> dtv2sertrans flash dump myrom.img

  dump the contents of the whole flash ROM into a file
  
> dtv2sertrans flash sync newrom.img

  transfer and write new contents into the flash ROM.
  only write the regions where the image file and the real ROM differ.
  this operation does only SIMULATE the operation and performs no flashing!
  
  by adding the -f switch this operation does the REAL THING and flashes!!!
  so you have been warned!!!

  see 'dtv2ser-flash.txt' for more details!


10. server commands (new in 0.4)
--------------------------------

> dtv2sertrans server ping

   check if the DTV has a running dtvtrans server available

> dtv2sertrans server info

   return information on the running dtvtrans server

> dtv2sertrans server ram

   make sure a dtvtrans server is running in RAM.
   if none is available then download dtvtrans prg and run it.
