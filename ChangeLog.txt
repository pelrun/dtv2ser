version 0.6 - 5.1.2018

 dtv2sertrans:
  * improved startup communications to make it more robust

 dtv2ser protocol:
  * remove OOB signalling using CTS - CTS is now for flow control only,
    protocol uses only the data on the line. Allows use of generic serial
    transports e.g. bluetooth or usb that synthesise flow control signals at
    each end.

 dtv2ser firmware:
  * Refactoring to separate AVR-specific code to allow porting
  * ARM port for the STM32F103 blue pill board ($2)
  * Remove joystream constraints - can now be used to relay joystick control
    from the PC end.
  * Refactor timebase to 1ms instead of split 100us/10ms. This requires
    stored parameters to be reset to new defaults.

version 0.5 - 11.12.2010

 dtv2sertrans:
  * fixed double open problem in pySerial on Windows
  * added missing 'g' command available in TLR's dtvtrans for usage compatibility  

 dtv2ser firmware:
  * added support for Arduino 2009 board (ATmega168, 16 MHz, 250kB/s transfer)

version 0.4 - 14.9.2008

 dtv2sertrans:
  * rewrote whole application and added a more generic command handler
  * added flash sub commands
  * added state tracking of dtvtrans server
  * added dtvtrans 1.0 commands, e.g. exit, init, load, run, save
  * added fill command to fill memory of DTV
  * added info command to query server information
  * added ping command to perform is-alive check of server
  * changed sys command now uses dtvtrans 1.0 sys, waits for result and
    does a sys_result to query the result values
  * added sys call diagnose to test reliability of sys call feature
  
 dtv2ser protocol:
  * due to size contraints: redesigned and streamlined protocol
  * added 'm' transfer mode command that replaces debug transfer commands
  * added 'a' is-alive check to query if server has a running dtvtrans
  * replaced all old dtvtrans commands with generic 'c' dtvtrans command

 dtv2ser firmware:
  * replaced debug transfer commands with one transfer routine that
    uses a toggle command to determine data flow
  * dtvtrans commands are not handled in the dtv2ser device anymore.
    commands are triggered with 'c' and the client passes all arguments and
    afterwards picks up the resulting output
  
version 0.3 - 2.3.2008
 
 dtv2sertrans:
  * fixed serial setup for windows
  * added 'bootstrap' command
  * added 'joy stream/type/wiggle' commands
  * added AutoType generator
  * added Screen Code compiler
  * added local command switches, e.g.: bootstrap -s full
  * added automatic file type detection by extension (*.bin, *.raw, *.prg)
  * added output of total transfer time and size
  
 dtv2ser protocol:
  * removed 't*' and replaced it with a single 't' command
  * removed command argument verification to save space
  * added 'js' command
  * added new data transfer protocol for read/write mem and boot
  * added transfer protocol for joystream
  
 dtv2ser firmware:
  * cleaned up and stream-lined command execution
  * added joystick output
  * added joystream execution
  * new RTS/CTS serial reception handling for fast dtvtrans 1.0 transfers
